Ever wanted to paint with your favorite plants?

I used the mouse pressed and released functions to make plant brushes that draws stems and various plants when released. One of the more challenging aspects of my plan was to have the rotation of the plants match the rotational direction of the stems. I somewhat achieved this by having multiple if/else statements that would change the rotation of the flower arc based on the value of mouseX-pmouseX. Overall, I would improve that aspect of the code if I could. Also add more variety to colors and size.
